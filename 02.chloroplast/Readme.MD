# Chloroplast proteins   
In total 431 Chloroplast genomes were downloaded, and annotated by prokka.   
Protein sequences of each genomes were extracted and orthofinder 2.2.7 were used to find the orthologous group.   
Based on the distribution, we selected 175 orthologous groups (present in at least 20 genomes) as the core chloroplast genome.
