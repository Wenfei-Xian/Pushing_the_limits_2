# Chloroplast proteins   
A total of 431 chloroplast genomes were downloaded (referenced by Accession.ID) and annotated using Prokka with its default parameters.   
The protein sequences from each genome were extracted, and OrthoFinder version 2.2.7 was employed to identify orthologous groups.   
Based on the observed distribution, we selected 176 orthologous groups, each present in at least 21 genomes, to represent the pan chloroplast genes.
